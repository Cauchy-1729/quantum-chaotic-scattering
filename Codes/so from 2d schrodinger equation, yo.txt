so from 2d schrodinger equation, you have to first go to "1d" by using the angular momentum basis. \psi_l(x) you have to solve for where the angular momentum is l. Once you know the wave functions you can compute the scattering matrix, given an initial asymptotic state e6{-ikx} and in some angular momentum 'l'. It will have scattering into angular momentum l'. This will give you S_{ll'} which will be a function if energy which is E. Then S_{ll'} you view this as a matrix in the l-space. For every E you will have a matrix, you truncate both l and l' to some l_{MAX} and compute the eigenvalues of this matrix for different E's. Then you can do the statistics.
